# Ivy DI

A simple, lightweight, and efficient runtime Dependency Injection (DI) container for Kotlin Multiplatform.
Ivy DI is a small dependency injection library with an intuitive API and limited features.

In a nutshell, you first register dependency factory functions in the container **Di.register { T() }** and then get instances via **Di.get\<T>()**.

### Features

- [Lightweight]()
- [One-line setup]()
- [Easy to use?]()
- [Auto-wiring]()
- [Singletons]()
- [Bindings]()
- [Qualifiers]()
- [Modules]()
- [Scopes]()
- [Lazy intitliazation]()

## Usage

### 0. Setup

You can find Ivy DI in our [Maven Central repository](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.ivy-apps/di).

**Gradle (Kotlin)**
```gradle
implementation("com.ivy-apps:di:0.0.0")
```

or

**Version Catalog**
```toml
[libraries]
ivyApps-di = { module = "com.ivy-apps:di", version = "0.0.0" }
```

Replace "0.0.0" with: [![Maven Central Version](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.ivy-apps/di)](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.ivy-apps/di)

That's all you need! Now let's start using Ivy DI ‚ö°

### 1. Register a dependency

```kotlin
class A
class B(val a: A)

Di.appScope {
  register { A() }
  register { B(a = Di.get() }
}
```

Instances of `A` and `B` won't be created until the dependencies are requested.

### 2. Get dependency instance

```kotlin
// instances of B and its dependencies will be created
Di.get<B>() // isntance 1 of B
Di.get<B>() // instance 2 of B
```

Each call to `Di.get()` creates a new instance for non-singleton dependencies.

### 3. Singleton dependencies

```kotlin
class Counter(var value = 0) {
  init { println("Counter created.")
}
Di.appScope {
  singleton { Counter() }
}

println(Di.get<Counter>().x) // Counter created. 0
Di.get<Counter>.x = 42
println(Di.get<Counter>()) // 42
```

Singleton dependencies will have only one **single instance** that will be created on the first `Di.get()` call.

### 4. Auto-wiring

```kotlin
class A
class B(val a: A)
class C(val a: A, val b: B)

Di.appScope {
  autoWireSingleton(::A)
  autoWire(::B)
  autoWire(::C)
}
```

To avoid repetitive code like `register { C(Di.get(), Di.get()) }` it's recommended to use auto-wiring.

### 5. Bindings

```kotlin
interface Platform
class AndroidPlatform : Platform

Di.appScope {
  autoWire(::AndroidPlatform)
  bind<Platform, AndroidPlatform>()
  // equivalent to:
  // register<Platform> { AndroidPlatform() }
}
Di.get<Platform>() // AndroidPlatform instance
```

To bind a specific implementation to an interface (or an abstract class) use `binds<Interface, Impl>()`. Note: `Impl` must be registered in the decency graph.

### 6. Named dependencies (qualifiers)

```kotlin
interface TimeFormatter
class H24TimeFormatter
class AmPmTimeFormatter

Di.appScope {
  autoWire(::H24TimeFormatter)
  autoWire(::AmPmTimeFormatter)
  bind<TimeFormatter, H24TimeFormatter>() // default
  bind<TimeFormatter, AmPmTimeFormatter(named = "am-pm")
}

Di.get<TimeFormatter>() // H24TimeFormatter
Di.get<TimeFormatter>(named = "am-pm") // AmPmTimeFormatter
```

Sometimes we need to have different instances of the same type. 
To achieve this in Ivy DI, we can set qualifiers using `named = "something"` (you're not limited only to strings because `named: Any`).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your "named" qualifiers must support equality checks (hashCode + equals).

### 7. Modules

TBD

## Advanced Usage

### 1. Scopes

Ivy DI supports grouping your dependencies into scopes so you can manage their lifecycle
and free resources as soon as the given scope is no longer needed. **AppScope** and **FeatureScope**
are built-in but you can easily define your own scopes using `Di.newScope("my-scope")`.

```kotlin
data class UserInfo(val id: String, name: String)

val UserScope = Di.newScope("user")
fun Di.userScope(block: Di.Scope.() -> Unit) = Di.scope(UserScope, block)

suspend fun login() {
  val userInfo = loginInternally()
  Di.userScope {
    // Register dependencies for the lifecycle of a user
    singleton { userInfo }
  }
}

// Note: This function must be called only for logged-in users, otherwise Di.get() will throw an exception.
suspend fun dashboard() {
  // Use user related dependencies
  val userInfo = Di.get<UserInfo>()
  println("Hello, ${userInfo.name}")
}

suspend fun logout() {
  // Free user-related dependencies
  Di.clear(UserScope)
}
```

### 2. Multibindings üöß

Currently not supported, investigating this use-case and whether we can support it nicely.

### 3. Lazy initialization

By default, all instances in Ivy DI are lazily initialized only after `Di.get()` is called.
However, there are cases where you might want to postpone the initialization further.
You can do that by wrapping your dependency in `Lazy<T>` and using `Di.getLazy()` instead.

```kotlin
class ArticlesDataSource(val client: Lazy<HttpClient>) {
  suspend fun fetchLatest(): List<Article> = client.value.get("url)
}
class ArticlesRepository(val source: ArticlesDataSource)

Di.appScope {
  singleton { HttpClient(CIO) }
  register {
    // autoWire won't work because you need to explicitly call Di.getLazy() instead of Di.get()
    ArticlesDatSource(Di.getLazy())
  }
  autoWire(::ArticlesRepository)
}
```

The instance of `HttpClient` will be created only after the `ArticlesDataSource#fetchLatest()` function is called.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

### Generics aren't supported

To avoid performance and compatibility problems we limit reflection to the bare minimum. 
Ivy DI uses only `KClass<*>` which unfortunately doesn't make a difference between the generic type of a class.

For example, if you register a factory for `Container<A>` and `Container<B>`, KClass will both treat them as just `Container`.
As an implication, only the factory for `Container<B>` will be registered.

### Maintenance

The library will be maintained as long as Ivy Apps Ltd has an interest in using it.
Given that Ivy DI currently has no community, the project may be abandoned in the future.
